	context</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Case III:
	The two surveys used independently estimated MDRIs (possibly for

	independently estimated FRRs</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%"><i><b>Crucial
note on choice of null hypothesis, calculation of p-values and
meaning of “power”</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">It is not
uncommon for a null hypothesis to be underspecified until the final
data is available, i.e. for certain details (such as a hypothetically
shared value of a test statistic) to be specified (estimated) in
light of the data.  In the present situation, the hypothetically
common value of incidence, as well as the (potentially different by
context) values of prevalence, cannot be reasonably supplied without
seeing the data.  Once data is available, there is further no unique,
obviously correct, approach to deriving these parameters, and
different choices can be entertained.  The simplest, but not
necessarily optimal, (indeed potentially problematic) approach is to
hypothesize that the two survey populations are identical in terms of
incidence AND prevalence, as this suggests a naïve pooling of all
data to provide the hypothetically common values.  However, a simple
test for difference of prevalence would be expected to lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis (of equal prevalence) in many, if
not most, cases, as prevalence will be relatively precisely
estimatable in any survey remotely powered to estimate incidence.
Hence, a more flexible approach to the null hypothesis is required.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The approach
taken in the present tool is to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">hypothesize
	that the incidence is the same in the two contexts</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">be agnostic
	on the matter of the value of this shared incidence</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">hypothesize
	that the estimated value of the variance of the incidence difference
	estimate (calculated carefully in accordance with the choice of how
	test properties are shared between the surveys) is a good estimate
	of the actual variance of the incidence difference. (This is
	equivalent to a routinely made assumption in less complex
	situations) 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">allow the
	prevalence for each context to be independently estimated from the
	data from that context.  (Note that even if the data does not
	support the rejection of the hypothesis that the prevalences are
	identical, there is little or no advantage in constructing the null
	hypothesis to include equal prevalence.)</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The preceding
assumptions allow the calculation of a p-value, which is done
according to a two-tailed test, capturing the point that the
experimenter has no basis to pre-determine the acceptable direction
of any incidence difference.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Note that while
it is common to report “power” as the probability of correctly
rejecting a null hypothesis, we are specifically insisting on a
two-tailed test, where the direction of any inferred difference will
specifically be either correct or incorrect.  Hence, we formally
calculate <i>the probability of correctly detecting the correct sign
of the incidence difference</i>.  Numerically, the probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis, but with the incorrect direction for
the inferred effect, will usually be very small, unless the study
design has no useful statistical power in any case.
