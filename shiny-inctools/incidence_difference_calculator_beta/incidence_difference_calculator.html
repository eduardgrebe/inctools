	context</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Case III:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%"><i><b>Crucial
note on choice of null hypothesis and calculation of p-values </b></i>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">It is not
uncommon for a null hypothesis to be underspecified until the final
data is available, i.e. for certain details (such as a hypothetically
shared value of a test statistic) to be specified (estimated) in
light of the data.  In the present situation, the hypothetically
common value of incidence, as well as the (potentially different by
context) values of prevalence, cannot be reasonably supplied without
seeing the data.  Once data is available, there is further no unique,
obviously correct, approach to deriving these parameters, and
different choices can be entertained.  The simplest, but not
necessarily optimal, (indeed potentially problematic) approach is to
hypothesize that the two survey populations are identical in terms of
incidence AND prevalence, as this suggests a naïve pooling of all
data to provide the hypothetically common values.  However, a simple
test for difference of prevalence would be expected to lead to the
rejection of the null hypothesis (of equal prevalence) in many, if
not most, cases, as prevalence will be relatively precisely
estimatable in any survey remotely powered to estimate incidence.
Hence, a more flexible approach to the null hypothesis is required.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The approach
taken in the present tool is to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">hypothesize
	that the incidence is the same in the two contexts</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">be agnostic
	on the matter of the value of this shared incidence</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">hypothesize
	that the estimated value of the variance of the incidence difference
	estimate (calculated carefully in accordance with the choice of how
	test properties are shared between the surveys) is a good estimate
	of the actual variance of the incidence difference. (This is
	equivalent to a routinely made assumption in less complex
	situations) 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">allow the
	prevalence for each context to be independently estimated from the
	data from that context.  (Note that even if the data does not
	support the rejection of the hypothesis that the prevalences are
	identical, there is little or no advantage in constructing the null
	hypothesis to include equal prevalence.)</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The preceding
assumptions allow the calculation of a p-value, which is done
according to a two-tailed test, capturing the point that the
experimenter has no basis to pre-determine the acceptable direction
of any incidence difference.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The three pairs
of <i>Incidence Difference/FRR Sensitivity</i> sheets correspond to
the three cases (I, II and III) described above.  The <i>Incidence
Difference</i> sheets are used both to enter inputs (sample counts,
characteristics of recency test(s) and survey designs) and to display
results (estimated incidence difference and 95% CI and p-value for
incidence difference).  The inputs of the <i>Incidence Difference</i>
sheets differ only to the extent required by the differences between
the three cases; the sheets are otherwise identical. The <i>FRR
Sensitivity</i> sheets display graphs of the incidence difference
estimate and p-value as functions of a hypothetical FRR (Case I) or
of two hypothetical FRRs (Cases II and III).  The sheets are
described in more detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%"><i>Context</i>:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Two
cross-sectional surveys have been carried out with a recency test (or
recency tests) whose properties (MDRI and FRR) have been estimated. 
Both HIV status and recent/non recent infection status amongst HIV
positives have been ascertained (although not necessarily for all
subjects). 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%"><i>Utility</i>:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">These sheets
calculate a separate incidence estimate for each of the two surveys
and an estimate of the incidence difference.  The relative standard
errors of the two individual incidence estimates are calculated as in
the <b>Incidence_Prevalence_Calculator</b>, and the estimate of the
relative standard error of the incidence difference is calculated to
be consistent with the choice made among the three cases, which
determines the extent of “recycling” of test property estimates
between the two individual incidence estimates.  A 95% CI and p-value
for the incidence difference are also reported.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">As in the
	other workbooks, subjects whose HIV status was left unascertained
	are nowhere accounted for in this analysis.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The
	calculation <i>does</i> account for HIV positive subjects whose
	recent/non-recent status was unascertained.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Incidences
	(and thus incidence difference) are reported as “instantaneous
	rates”, with units of % per annum (p.a.).</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Warnings
	about negative incidence estimates are indeed “warnings’ and not
	“errors”, even though, physically, incidence of course takes
	strictly non-negative values.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The relative
	standard error of an individual incidence estimate is not reported
	if the estimate is less than or equal to zero.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The relative
	standard error of the incidence difference estimate is not reported
	if the estimate is zero; it is reported in all other cases. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">If the
	p-value for the incidence difference is greater than or equal to
	0.0005, it is displayed to three decimal places; if it is below
	0.0005, it is displayed as “&lt;0.001”.

Sensitivity (I/II/III)</b></i><b>&gt;</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Each of these
sheets plots the incidence difference and p value as a function of a
hypothetical FRR (Case I) or as a function of two hypothetical FRRs
(Cases II and III).  Each <i>FRR Sensitivity</i> sheet is linked its
corresponding <i>Incidence Difference</i> sheet – a change to an
input on an <i>Incidence Difference</i> sheet will automatically
carry through to the figures.  Intermediate results required to
populate the figures are found on hidden sheets, which may be
unhidden without password (<i>home tab, cells toolbar, format button
→ </i>drop down menu:<i> hide &amp; unhide → </i>secondary
dropdown,<i> unhide sheet</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">Note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">In Case I
	the two surveys use the same FRR estimate – and so a single
	two-dimensional figure suffices and also shows a 95% CI for
	incidence difference. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">In Cases II
	and III the two surveys use independent FRR estimates – the
	figures are thus three-dimensional, and a 95% CI for incidence
	difference is not included. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The FRRs are
	hypothetical, assumed to be known precisely.</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 107%">The graphs
	show values of the hypothetical FRR(s) from 0 to 4%. This is for
	completeness only, and should not be interpreted as suggesting the
	higher values in this range are likely to lead to informative
	estimates.
