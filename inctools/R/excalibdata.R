#' The dataset `excalibdata.Rdata` contains example data from an evaluation of
#' an assay measuring recency of infection. At an assay result of <10, the
#' specimen is considered to be recently infected. It further contains viral
#' load data, which is commonly used to reduce false recency. For example,
#' when recency is defined as assay result <10 and viral load > 1000, the FRR
#' is substantially lower (but the MDRI is also reduced).
