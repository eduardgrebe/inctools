\arguments{
\item{I1}{Predicted incidence of HIV in survey 1.}

\item{I2}{Predicted incidence of HIV in survey 2.}

\item{PrevH1}{Predicted prevalence of HIV in survey 1.}

\item{PrevH2}{Predicted prevalence of HIV in survey 2.}

\item{n1}{Sample size for survey 1. If equal sample sizes for both surveys are desired at a given power level, both n1 and n2 must have value 'both', which is the default.}

\item{n2}{Sample size for survey 2. If equal sample sizes for both surveys are desired at a given power level, both n1 and n2 must have value 'both', which is the default.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for test (default alpha=0.05).}

\item{Power}{Desired power used to calculate a sample size for the surveys. Default is 0.80, meaning the function outputs the necessary sample size to achieve stated power for a test of differences in incidence. If Power is set to 'out', function will return power of detecting a difference in incidences for given sample size inputs.}

\item{SS}{Sample size. Default is 'out', meaning the function takes a power argument and outputs a common sample size needed to achieve power level for test of differences for incidence. If power is desired for a given sample size, parameter value is irrelevant; however, values for n1 and n2 must be specified.}

\item{CR}{Coverage rate (0-1).}

\item{DE_H}{Design effect of HIV prevalence test (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{DE_R}{Design effect of recency test (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{BMest}{Biomarker test parameter (MDRI, FRR, and RSE) estimation by one the 3 options 'same.test'(default), 'FRR.indep', 'MDRI.FRR.indep' (string).}

\item{MDRI}{mean duration of recent infection [days] (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{RSE_MDRI}{Relative standard error of MDRI [days] (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{FRR}{False recent rate (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{RSE_FRR}{Relative standard error of FRR (vector/integer). If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{BigT}{Post-infection time cut-off (days). Default 730. If a single value is specified, that value is assumed to be the value for both surveys.}

\item{Boot}{True/False variable indicating whether variance of point estimates is to be calculated by Empirical Bootstrapping (TRUE) or Delta Method (FALSE), the default setting.}

\item{BS_Count}{Specifies number of bootstrap samples for bootstrapped confidence intervals of incidence.}

\item{Cov.PrevH.I}{Covariance of prevalence and incidence for bootstrap resampling.}

\item{debug}{Enable debugging mode (browser)}
}
\value{
Common sample size of two surveys--or the sample size of one survey given the other has already been completed--necessary to achieve a given power level for testing a null hypothesis that the incidence rates are identical between populations; alternatively, the power of said test under a particular sample size scenario. Function also returns implied statistics from input values on paramters, confidence limits, and population counts.
